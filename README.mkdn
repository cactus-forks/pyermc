pyermc
======

### oogah! Highly experimental!

## About

pyermc is a memcache client utilizing the [ultramemcache][1] driver. It is
somewhat compatible with [python-memcached][2]. Full compatibility is not a
design goal, however.

## Features

*   pickle support
*   gevent/eventlet compatible (ultramemcache uses python socket)
*   uses [lz4][3] for compression instead of gzip (fast)

## Benchmarks

To run the benchmark script, you will need to pip install python-memcached
and manually clone mixpanel's [memcache_client][4] repo.
